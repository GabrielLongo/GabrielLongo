Hi, Iâ€™m @GabrielLongo

Iâ€™m interested in Free and Open-Source tech (FOSS or FLOSS), Linux, DevOps, Automation, Hardware and eletronics.

Iâ€™m currently learning Angular, TypeScript, Containers (Podman, Docker, etc), Shell Script, Flatpak (and other packaging systems), Python, Java, C/C++ and Rust. 

Well, many things I can't accomplish at the same time, but i'm trying to do a little bit at time..
